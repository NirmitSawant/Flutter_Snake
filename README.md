# Snake Game

2D Snake Game we all have played atleast once.
Using Flutter as Game Engine xDDDDDDD.
Since Flutter is capable of rendering UI at up to 60 FPS, I exploit that capability to build a simple 2D Snake game in Flutter

## Where did I learn this?

## Updates in future:
- To end game if the snake collides with itself
- Adding various modes and levels
- Track of users score and highscore _because all of us want to win_ :')
- Adding pew pew sounds 
- Improving boundaries and random function to avoid intial collision!
